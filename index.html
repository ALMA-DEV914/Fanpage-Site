    <h2>About Air Supply</h2>
    <p>Australian MOR/soft-pop group Air Supply started recording in the mid-'70s, but it was their first US album, 1980's LOST IN LOVE, that brought them a flurry of hits ("Lost in Love," "Every Woman in the World," "All out of Love") and international acclaim. The heart of the band is singer/songwriters Russell Hitchcock and Graham Russell, whose gentle voices and delicately..</p><br>
    <p>"We started making recordings in 1976 and had our first success in Australia, and we thought maybe five years at the most. To consider it's been four decades now: So many shows, so many countries, and we've seen so much and achieved so much, it's been quite amazing for us."</p><br>
    <p>Air Supply landed eight singles in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, all between 1980 and 1983. With the release of their first album, Air Supply, on Australian label Rainbow Records in 1976, Air Supply, named because both founding members have air zodiac signs, began a decade of controlling the pop album and single charts by releasing one hit after another.</p><br>

    <p><strong>Active from: 1975</strong></p>
